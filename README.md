Dielectric Fitter
=================
Dielectric Fitter will be a tool to fit multiple dielectric spectra, and export fit parameters; There are tools that do that and are quite nice, but this is my way of learning C++;

##List of things to implement:##

* Complex Levenberg Marquardt fitting using Havriliak Negami function, or multiple such functions;
Partially done;
* Constructing Arrhenius graph, and fitting it to retrieve activation energy;
* Same with Vogel-Fulcher plot;
