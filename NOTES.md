#Notes to myself#
1. What I iplemented is plain gradient descent. It's slow, but at least it's working, but not with alpha parameter;
I'm thinking about rewriting the code to take vector values. It would be easier to implement proper Leveberg-Marquardt method then.
To implement next method I must probably change notation;
2. I think I need to move data storage to some class, and make it global or static;
